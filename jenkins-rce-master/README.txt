JENKINS UNAUTHENTICATED REMOTE CODE EXECUTION
---------------------------------------------

Exploit compiled by me, but full credits for exploit discovery and exploit chaining go to Orange Tsai (orange.tw).

It chains CVE-2018-1000861, CVE-2019-1003005 and CVE-2019-1003029 to a more reliable and elegant pre-auth remote code execution!

- In the URL payload, replace <TARGET HOST> with the hostname of the server, and <EXPLOIT HOST> to the hostname of where you uploaded your files.
